# üß¨ AMBER TLeap Input Script

This page provides a detailed explanation of each line in a typical `tleap.in` file used for preparing molecular systems for AMBER simulations.

---

## üìå What is the purpose of the `tleap.in` file?

This script prepares your molecular system for MD simulation by:

- ‚úÖ Loading the correct force fields  
- ‚úÖ Applying custom ligand parameters  
- ‚úÖ Adding missing atoms and hydrogens  
- ‚úÖ Defining special bonds (like disulfide bridges)  
- ‚úÖ Neutralizing the charge of your system  
- ‚úÖ Solvating it in water  
- ‚úÖ Outputting the two essential AMBER files: `prmtop` and `inpcrd`

## üîç Line-by-Line Explanation

### üî∑ Force Field and Parameter Loading

#### ‚úÖ `source leaprc.protein.ff19SB`

- **What it does**: Loads the `ff19SB` protein force field into TLeap.
- **Purpose**: Defines how amino acids behave ‚Äî their charges, connectivity, and torsions.
- **Why needed**: Without this, AMBER can‚Äôt simulate protein structure correctly.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `leaprc.protein.ff14SB`: older, still common.
  - `leaprc.protein.fb15`: more accurate but requires polarizable water.

#### ‚úÖ `source leaprc.gaff2`

- **What it does**: Loads GAFF2 ‚Äî a force field for small organic molecules.
- **Purpose**: Tells AMBER how to interpret ligands and non-protein molecules.
- **Why needed**: If your system includes a drug or ligand, this is essential.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `gaff`: older, less accurate.
  - `openff`: from the Open Force Field consortium (requires conversion).

#### ‚úÖ `source leaprc.lipid21`

- **What it does**: Loads the `lipid21` force field.
- **Purpose**: Enables correct modeling of lipid bilayers (e.g., membranes).
- **Why needed**: Needed if your system contains membrane lipids or cholesterol.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `lipid17` or `lipid14`: older versions.

#### ‚úÖ `source leaprc.water.tip3p`

- **What it does**: Loads the `TIP3P` water model.
- **Purpose**: Tells AMBER how to model water molecules in your simulation.
- **Why needed**: Essential for solvating your system and simulating hydration.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `tip4p-ew`, `tip5p`: more accurate, but computationally heavier.

#### ‚úÖ `loadamberparams frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p`

- **What it does**: Loads improved ion parameters compatible with TIP3P water.
- **Purpose**: Enhances ion-water interactions (e.g., Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫, Cl‚Åª).
- **Why needed**: Avoids unrealistic behavior like overly strong ion binding.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `frcmod.ions94`: older, less accurate.

#### ‚úÖ `loadamberprep PIP.prepi`

- **What it does**: Loads a `.prepi` library file that defines the **structure, atom types, charges, and bonding** for a **custom ligand**, such as **PIP2**.
- **Purpose**: It tells AMBER how to **build the ligand** from scratch ‚Äî because unlike proteins or water, ligands are not predefined in the standard force fields.
- **Why it's needed**: TLeap has **no knowledge of custom ligands by default**, so this file acts as a blueprint. Without it, AMBER would not know how to assign atoms, bonds, or charges.

#### ‚úÖ `loadamberparams PIP.frcmod`

- **What it does**: Loads a `.frcmod` file that includes **missing force field parameters** (usually for torsion angles, improper dihedrals, or van der Waals terms) that were **not automatically found** when building the ligand with GAFF2.
- **Purpose**: Completes the force field definition for the ligand, ensuring AMBER has everything it needs to simulate the molecule accurately.
- **Why it's needed**: GAFF2 covers a wide range of chemical space, but sometimes it **can‚Äôt assign all parameters** automatically. This file fills in those missing definitions.
> **Note**: If you have multiple ligands (e.g., PIP2, ATP, inhibitor), you‚Äôll need to repeat these last two steps for each one using separate `.prepi` and `.frcmod` files.
---

### üî∑ Structure Loading and Preparation

### ‚úÖ `abc = loadpdb protein1.pdb`

- **What it does**: Loads your input protein structure (`protein1.pdb`) into a variable called `abc`.
- **Purpose**: TLeap reads the atomic coordinates so it can begin building your system.
- **Hydrogens**: If hydrogens are missing (as is often the case in experimental structures), TLeap **automatically adds them** based on the loaded force field and assumed protonation states.
- **Note**: These additions are based on **standard pH (~7.0)**, unless specified otherwise.

### ‚úÖ `savepdb abc first_with_hydrogens.pdb`

- **What it does**: Saves the `abc` structure (now with added hydrogens) to a new file.
- **Purpose**: Allows you to check and confirm that hydrogens were added correctly.
- **Why it's useful**: You can open this file in PyMOL, Chimera, or VMD to **visually inspect** the modified structure before proceeding.

### ‚úÖ `mol = loadpdb first_with_hydrogens.pdb`

- **What it does**: Reloads the saved structure (with hydrogens) into a new variable `mol`.
- **Purpose**: Creates a fresh working copy of the updated structure for the next steps (e.g., adding bonds, solvating).
- **Why it's done**: Reloading ensures you're always working with a **complete and updated version** of the molecule, including hydrogens and any other early modifications.

---

### üî∑ Manual Bond Definitions

#### ‚úÖ `bond mol.80.SG mol.112.SG` *(and others)*

- **What it does**: Manually defines a covalent bond between the SG (sulfur) atoms of two cysteine residues.
- **Purpose**: This creates a **disulfide bridge (‚ÄìS‚ÄìS‚Äì)**, a covalent link that stabilizes protein structure.
- **Why it‚Äôs needed**:
  - AMBER **does not automatically guess disulfide bonds** based on distance ‚Äî so you must add them yourself if missing.
- **Residue types**: When a disulfide bond is defined, **TLeap automatically treats the cysteines as `CYX`** (modified CYS residues with one hydrogen removed from the SG atom).
- **When you skip this step**:
  - Proteins with structural disulfides might **misfold** or **collapse** during simulation.
  - Important functions may be lost if the disulfide bridge is **biologically essential** (e.g., in extracellular proteins or enzymes).
- **How to know if a bond is needed**:
  - Check your original PDB file for `SSBOND` lines like:
    ```
    SSBOND 1 CYS A   80    CYS A  112
    ```
---

### üî∑ Ion Addition

#### ‚úÖ `addions mol K+ 0`  
#### ‚úÖ `addions mol Cl- 0`
- **What it does**: Adds **potassium (K‚Å∫)** and **chloride (Cl‚Åª)** ions to your system.
- **Purpose**: **Neutralizes the net charge** of the system so that molecular dynamics simulations run stably.
- **What `0` means**: By passing `0`, you tell TLeap to **automatically calculate the number of ions needed** to neutralize the system‚Äôs total charge.
- **Why it's needed**:
  - Simulating a charged system without neutralizing ions can result in **instabilities or artifacts**, particularly in long simulations.
  - Many MD engines assume or require charge neutrality for proper treatment of periodic boundary conditions and electrostatics.
- **When used together**: If your system is negatively charged, only **K‚Å∫** will be added. If positively charged, only **Cl‚Åª** will be added.
- Alternatives: specify exact numbers or use `addionsrand`.
- Note: We add extra K‚Å∫ ions to neutralize charge and mimic physiological conditions, while the K‚Å∫ ions we study for movement are manually placed and tracked separately.

---

### üî∑ Solvation

#### ‚úÖ `solvatebox mol TIP3PBOX 0.1`

- **What it does**: Surrounds your system (`mol`) with a rectangular box of **TIP3P water molecules**.
- **Purpose**: Ensures the protein or complex is fully immersed in solvent, which is necessary for realistic molecular dynamics.
- **Padding**: `0.1` means 0.1 nm (or 1 √Ö) between the molecule and the edge of the box.  
- **Box shape**: `TIP3PBOX` creates an orthorhombic (rectangular) box using the TIP3P water model.
- **Alternatives**:
  - `solvateoct`: Creates a **truncated octahedral box**, which can save computational resources for roughly spherical systems.
- **Why it's important**:
  - Water is needed for proteins to fold, move, and behave normally.
  - It protects the system from edge effects when periodic boundaries are used.
  - It allows ions and water to flow freely around the molecule, like in a real cell.
  
---

### üî∑ Saving Outputs

#### ‚úÖ `savepdb mol with_water.pdb`

- **What it does**: Saves the entire system (protein + water + ions) into a PDB file.
- **Purpose**: Allows you to open the fully prepared structure in a visualization tool like PyMOL or Chimera.
- **Why it's useful**: Lets you visually confirm:
  - Water box is correctly placed
  - Ions are distributed properly
  - No missing atoms or overlaps

#### ‚úÖ `saveamberparm mol com.prmtop com.inpcrd`

- **What it does**: Generates the two key files that AMBER needs to start a simulation.
- **`com.prmtop` (topology file)**:
  - Contains all molecular information: atom types, charges, masses, bonds, angles, and force field parameters.
- **`com.inpcrd` (coordinate file)**:
  - Stores the 3D coordinates of all atoms and the box dimensions after solvation and ion placement.
- **Why it's essential**:
  - These files are used in all simulation steps (minimization, heating, MD).
  - Without them, AMBER cannot simulate the system.

# üß™ My Example: Preparing the GIRK2 Channel (3SYC)

To test this workflow, I used the structure [**3SYC**](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3SYC), which is the **crystal structure of the G protein-gated inward rectifier K‚Å∫ channel GIRK2 (Kir3.2), D228N mutant**. The structure contains **only the protein** (no ligands), and I wanted to simulate it using AMBER.

At first, I thought I could follow the one-file `tleap.in` approach shown above, but I quickly discovered that it wouldn‚Äôt work for this system. Here's why:

---

## ‚ùå Why a Single `tleap.in` File Wasn't Enough

### 1. üîç The PDB Includes a Disulfide Bond That TLeap Won‚Äôt Handle Automatically

In the original PDB file, there is a clear disulfide bond listed:

```
SSBOND   1 CYS A  134    CYS A  166                          1555   1555  2.04
```

You might think that this means you can write in `tleap.in`:

```bash
bond mol.134.SG mol.166.SG
```

But **this won‚Äôt work** ‚Äî and here‚Äôs why:

---

### 2. üß¨ The Atom Indexing Changes After Adding Hydrogens

In the original PDB, the residue numbering begins at residue **55**:

```
ATOM      1  N   ILE A  55      ...
```

But when you load this into TLeap and save a new PDB (e.g., `first_with_hydrogens.pdb`), the residues get **renumbered starting at 1**. So:

- Original residue **CYS 134** might become **residue 80**
- Original **CYS 166** might become **residue 112**, for example

This means the line `bond mol.134.SG mol.166.SG` will fail, because those residue numbers **no longer exist** in the modified file.

---

### 3. üß™ The CYS Residues Must Be Renamed to CYX

Even if you get the new residue numbers right, you‚Äôll hit another problem:

- **TLeap expects disulfide-forming cysteines to be named `CYX`**, not `CYS`
- If you leave them as `CYS`, the bond may not be recognized and will generate errors during parameter assignment

---

### 4. üßº The HG Hydrogen Must Be Deleted

One last critical detail:  
Each cysteine residue normally contains a **hydrogen atom named HG** attached to the sulfur (SG). But when forming a disulfide bond:

- **That hydrogen must be removed manually**, or TLeap will complain about missing torsion parameters involving HG
- You‚Äôll get an error like `no torsion terms for atom types HS-SH-SH-HS`

---

## ‚úÖ My Solution: Modular Automation

To fix all of this, I created a modular, automated workflow that:

1. Uses a first `tleap` script to **add missing hydrogens**
2. Uses a Python script to:
   - Parse the original residue numbers
   - Create a `tleap.in` file with the **correct mapped numbers**
   - Generate a `rename_cys_to_cyx.sh` script to:
     - Rename `CYS ‚Üí CYX`
     - Delete the HG hydrogen from each CYX
3. Runs everything step-by-step inside a clean output folder

---

## üì• Want to Try It Yourself?

If you want to reproduce this with 3SYC:

### üîß Step 1: Download the PDB file
Go to [3SYC](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3SYC), download it, and save it as:

```
3syc.pdb
```

### üß™ Step 2: Run the full preparation script

```bash
bash run_full_preparation.sh 3syc.pdb
```

This will:
- Add hydrogens
- Fix the CYS ‚Üí CYX renaming and HG deletion
- Add ions and water
- Generate all required AMBER input files (`.prmtop`, `.inpcrd`, solvated PDB)

All output files will be stored in the folder `3syc/`.
